### Modelling
Which type of Model is the preferred one?
1st version of Model with “possible parameters”

### Evaluation
Decide on “Method”, already done on Business Case, review that
Decide on “goal” when it comes to this evaluation method
Change parameters or maybe even model type for “better” model

Insert model and deploy the application (locally?)

Probably irrelevant,Refining, evaluating again and the re-deploying
